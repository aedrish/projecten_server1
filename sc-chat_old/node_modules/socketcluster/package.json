E.g:\n\n```js\nvar socketCluster = new SocketCluster({\n  workers: 1,\n  stores: 1,\n  // ...\n  myCustomBrokerOption: 'bla',\n  anotherCustomBrokerOption: 'foo',\n  // ...\n});\n```\n\nThis change was also implemented in **sc-redis** although we now use a storeOptions property to hold all store-related properties.\nSo now, inside the storeController, we access the custom storeOptions property from ```store.options.storeOptions``` - This is for backwards compatibility.\nIf you ```npm update socketcluster``` just make sure that you also ```npm update sc-redis``` - You shouldn't need to change any of your code.\n\n\n## Introduction\n\nSocketCluster is a fast, highly scalable HTTP + realtime server engine which lets you build multi-process \nrealtime servers that make use of all CPU cores on a machine/instance.\nIt removes the limitations of having to run your Node.js server as a single thread and makes your backend \nresilient by automatically recovering from worker crashes and aggregating errors into a central log.\n\nFollow the project on Twitter: https://twitter.com/SocketCluster\nSubscribe for updates: http://socketcluster.launchrock.com/\n\n## Memory leak profile\n\nSocketCluster has been tested for memory leaks.\nThe last full memory profiling was done on SocketCluster v0.9.17 (Node.js v0.10.28) and included checks on worker and broker processes.\n\nNo memory leaks were detected when using the latest Node.js version.\nNote that leaks were found when using Node.js versions below v0.10.22 - This is probably the Node.js 'Walmart' memory leak - Not a SocketCluster issue.\n\n## Main Contributors\n\n- Jonathan Gros-Dubois\n- Nelson Zheng\n- wactbprot (nData)\n- epappas (nData)\n- Gabriel Muller\n\n## Installation\n\nThere are two ways to install SocketCluster.\n\n### The easy way (Sets up boilerplate - Ready to run):\n\nSetup the socketcluster command:\n\n```bash\nnpm install -g socketcluster\n```\n\nOR \n\n```bash\nsudo npm install -g socketcluster\n```\n\nThen\n\n```bash\nsocketcluster create myapp\n```\n\nOnce it's installed, go to your new myapp/ directory and launch with:\n\n```bash\nnode server\n```\n\nAccess at URL http://localhost:8000/\n\n### The hard way (More modular - Separate server and client):\n\n```bash\nnpm install socketcluster\n```\n\nYou will also need to install the client separately which you can get using the following command:\n\n```bash\nnpm install socketcluster-client\n```\n\nThe socketcluster-client script is called socketcluster.js (located in the main socketcluster-client directory) \n- You should include it in your HTML page using a &lt;script&gt; tag in order to interact with SocketCluster.\nFor more details on how to use socketcluster-client, go to https://github.com/SocketCluster/socketcluster-client\n\nIt is recommended that you use Node.js version >=0.10.22 due to memory leaks present in older versions.\n\n### Using over HTTPS\n\nIn order to run SocketCluster over HTTPS, all you need to do is set the protocol to 'https' and \nprovide your private key and certificate as a start option when you instantiate SocketCluster - Example:\n\n```js\nvar socketCluster = new SocketCluster({\n  workers: 3,\n  brokers: 3,\n  port: 8000,\n  appName: 'myapp',\n  workerController: 'worker.js',\n  protocol: 'https',\n  protocolOptions: {\n    key: fs.readFileSync(__dirname + '/keys/enc_key.pem', 'utf8'),\n    cert: fs.readFileSync(__dirname + '/keys/cert.pem', 'utf8'),\n    passphrase: 'passphase4privkey'\n  }\n});\n```\n\nThe protocolOptions option is exactly the same as the one you pass to a standard Node HTTPS server:\nhttp://nodejs.org/api/https.html#https_https_createserver_options_requestlistener\n\n\n## Contribute to SocketCluster\n\n- More integration test cases needed\n- Unit tests\n- Efficiency/speed - faster is better!\n- Suggestions?\n\nTo contribute; clone this repo, then cd inside it and then run npm install to install all dependencies.\n\n## License\n\n(The MIT License)\n\nCopyright (c) 2013-2015 SocketCluster.io\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the 'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
